In this assignment, you will create a fully styled website with two pages and an external stylesheet. The content of the page is your choice: create a personal web page or a page on any topic of your choosing.

What to do

Launch your text editor. Itâ€™ll open up to a blank, empty file, probably with a black background.

Create a folder on your computer. This is the root directory of your project--the folder that contains all the files and folders that comprise your site. Name that folder yourLastNameyourFirstInitialA1   .

Create a new file. Name the file index.html (this is  VERY IMPORTANT--DO NOT name it anything else!) and save it inside your root directory.

Create at least one additional HTML document/page for the project. Name it something simple but indicative of its purpose--for example, "about.html". Save it inside your root directory.

Add the necessary basic HTML starter code to both HTML documents. 

Within your root directory, create a sub-directory called "css". Create a CSS document. Name it "styles.css", and save it inside the "css" sub-directory. Add a link to styles.css in the appropriate place in both of your HTML documents.

Populate your HTML documents with content and your CSS stylesheet with styles. Here are the requirements for your finished site:

The primary layout of both pages must include a header, a footer, and a main content area.
There should be a navigation menu made up of an unordered list with at least three list items that function as links. These list items should lead to both relative and absolute locations; one nav item on each page must lead to the other page.
Your style rules should use pseudo-classes to style at least two of the following link states: link, visited, hover, and active.
There should be text elements of at least three levels of hierarchy (that is, h1, h2, h3, etc.) organized appropriately.
There should be at least ten different CSS rule sets (each consisting of a selector and declaration block).
HTML structural/semantic element names should be used whenever possible; classes and at least one ID should be used as well.
You should use box model, display, and position properties to align and position your elements in the layout. 
There should be at least one image, added via a relative URL.
Beyond these requirements, feel free to include whatever content you like and as much additional CSS to design your pages as you like. Again, remember to test everything locally in your browser.
